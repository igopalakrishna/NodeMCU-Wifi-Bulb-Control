# NodeMUC-Wifi-Bulb-Control Experiment
	
 Bulb Control using NodeMCU via Wi-Fi interface
NodeMCU
•	NodeMCU is an open-source firmware and development kit that enables the development of IoT (Internet of Things) projects using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. It combines both hardware and software elements to provide a platform for building connected devices and applications. 
•	NodeMCU is built around the ESP8266 module, which is a low-cost Wi-Fi microcontroller with integrated TCP/IP protocol stack.
•	The ESP8266 module is the heart of NodeMCU and provides the processing power and Wi-Fi connectivity needed for IoT applications.
•	NodeMCU offers built-in Wi-Fi support, enabling devices to connect to local networks and the internet.
Arduino 
•	Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is an open-source software platform designed for writing, compiling, and uploading code to Arduino microcontroller boards. It simplifies the process of programming microcontrollers, making it accessible to beginners and experienced developers alike.
•	The IDE supports a wide range of Arduino boards, including the popular Arduino Uno, Arduino Mega, and many others.
•	Users can select the appropriate board when writing code, ensuring compatibility.
•	Arduino IDE includes a vast library of functions and examples that simplify common tasks.
•	Users can access pre-written code for sensors, actuators, displays, and more, reducing the need to start from scratch.
